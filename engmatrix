## <span style="color:#C04A1A;"><strong>Engineering Skills Matrix — CI/CD Target Model Addendum</strong></span>

### <span style="color:#C04A1A;"><strong>Context</strong></span>

The original engineering skills matrix intentionally captured **all existing skills** across the current team, including legacy and maintenance-oriented capabilities.  
This was necessary to establish an accurate baseline of *where we are today*.

However, under the **target delivery model** (CI/CD-driven, automation-first, separated maintenance vs new feature development), the skills matrix must evolve.

### <span style="color:#C04A1A;"><strong>What Changes with the New Model</strong></span>

As Prism moves toward a CI/CD-based delivery system, the engineering organization must support:

- Automated testing
- Pipeline-driven releases
- Infrastructure-as-code
- Artifact-driven delivery gates
- Reduced manual QA and ad hoc deployment work

This introduces **new skill requirements** that are either:
